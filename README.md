# Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio v2, it's created using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.  

My inspiration for this project is that my [portfolio v1](https://github.com/PakmanGames/portfolio) was created using mostly vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but as I attempted to refactor it and slowly integrate features such as implementing the styling using Tailwind CSS, I realized I am doing a lot of extra work that just isn't necessary. And thus I decided it was the best choice to start over but use a powerful framework like Next.js from the very beginning.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
